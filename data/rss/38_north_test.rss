										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Korea’s attempts to block foreign information from the country could soon face their most significant challenge to date. After years of combating the smuggling in of information via USBs, SD cards and other portable data delivery devices, as well as jamming of radio and satellite signals throughout the country, a new type of telecommunications satellite may offer a way to break through the information blockade.</p>
<p>This new type of satellite, expected to enter service in 2024, can communicate directly with smartphones, including two-way text messages, calls and eventually Internet access from anywhere without the need for a special handset or a satellite dish. All that is required is an account with a carrier that has partnered with the satellite service and a clear view of the sky.</p>
<p>While its main purpose is to provide supplemental coverage to existing cellular networks in rural and remote areas, it could potentially be one of the biggest advances in information access in decades.</p>
<p>Satellite technology has long been considered a way to get information into authoritarian countries and bypass state censorship, but the intense monitoring and control in North Korea makes it highly unlikely that citizens could get away with hiding a satellite dish. Furthermore, existing satellite phones are bulky, data transfers are slow and the costs of both terminals and service are high. They also transmit on dedicated satellite frequencies that make them easier to detect and jam.</p>
<p>At present, illicit information and content transfer occurs along the country’s northern border with China, either by physical USB stick or memory card, or via Chinese smartphones and cellular signals that spill over the border. Both methods are risky and North Korean authorities actively hunt out those involved.</p>
<p>These new telecommunications satellites offer a way to freely communicate from anywhere in North Korea—not just the northern border areas—making it more difficult for the North Korean regime to monitor information related activities around the country. But while the technology itself is the most expensive and a difficult part of making such communications possible, it is only one part of the equation.</p>
<p><strong>The Technology</strong></p>
<p>The new type of satellite can work with existing smartphones because it broadcasts a conventional cellular signal, making it essentially a cell tower in space. Existing satellite phones use a proprietary protocol and different frequencies dedicated to satellite use.</p>
<p>One such satellite, the Blue Walker 3, is already in orbit. It was launched in September 2022 by Texas-based AST Space Mobile. It can provide 4G LTE and 5G cellular signals from a 64-square meter antenna that unfolds once the satellite reaches orbit.</p>
<figure id="attachment_29050" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-29050" style="width: 1430px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.38north.org/fig1-sat-to-cell-23-1020/"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" class="size-full wp-image-29050" src="https://www.38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Fig1-Sat-to-Cell-23-1020.jpg" alt="" width="1430" height="805" srcset="https://www.38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Fig1-Sat-to-Cell-23-1020.jpg 1430w, https://www.38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Fig1-Sat-to-Cell-23-1020-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Fig1-Sat-to-Cell-23-1020-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Fig1-Sat-to-Cell-23-1020-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1430px) 100vw, 1430px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-29050" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 1. A simulated image of the BlueWalker 3 satellite in orbit (Source: AST SpaceMobile).</figcaption></figure>
<p>Earlier this year, AST SpaceMobile 4G LTE connectivity at 10M bps from space. In early September, engineers <a href="https://ast-science.com/2023/09/19/ast-spacemobile-achieves-space-based-5g-cellular-broadband-connectivity-from-everyday-smartphones-another-historic-world-first/">a 5G satellite video call</a> from an unmodified Samsung S22 smartphone in a cellular blackspot in Maui, Hawaii, to a phone in Madrid, Spain. The company it also achieved a 14 Mbps satellite data connection, which is significantly faster than current satellite phone systems.</p>
<p>AST SpaceMobile already has agreements with 40 mobile carriers around the world and plans to launch its first five commercial satellites in early 2024 and a commercial service later that year.</p>
<p>California-based Space X is planning to bring smartphone calling to its Starlink satellites next year as well. The planned <a href="https://direct.starlink.com/">direct-to-phone satellite service</a> will deliver a 4G LTE signal for text messaging in 2024 and for voice and data communications in 2025. It has yet to demonstrate its service.</p>
<p><strong>The Coverage</strong></p>
<p>While the planned satellite constellations are technically capable of delivering a signal to anywhere on the planet, there are still limits to how it can be accessed. Legal and commercial concerns will still apply, meaning the potential may not be realized in a country like North Korea.</p>
<p>First, users will need a smartphone with a SIM card from a partner carrier. For North Korea, the security measures on North Korean phones mean foreign SIM cards and apps will not work on them, so a compatible phone would still have to be smuggled into the country. This is common practice even for getting Chinese smartphones that can currently be used near the border, so is not an insurmountable issue.</p>
<p>The much bigger issue is the legal one.</p>
<p>Regulations of the 4G and 5G cellular signals used by the satellites are handled on a country-by-country basis, so AST Space Mobile and SpaceX need to work with national partners to gain permission to provide service.</p>
<p>This can be seen with the current plan for Starlink Internet service in South Korea and other nations. Coverage is usually only switched on for cells that are completely inside a national border, leaving border areas, where cells straddle two countries, unserved.</p>
<figure id="attachment_29049" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-29049" style="width: 1428px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.38north.org/fig2-sat-to-cell-23-1020/"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-29049" src="https://www.38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Fig2-Sat-to-Cell-23-1020.jpg" alt="" width="1428" height="804" srcset="https://www.38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Fig2-Sat-to-Cell-23-1020.jpg 1428w, https://www.38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Fig2-Sat-to-Cell-23-1020-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Fig2-Sat-to-Cell-23-1020-1024x577.jpg 1024w, https://www.38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Fig2-Sat-to-Cell-23-1020-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1428px) 100vw, 1428px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-29049" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 2. Planned Starlink Internet service coverage in South Korea finishes short of the inter-Korean border (Source: Space X).</figcaption></figure>
<p>It is unclear exactly how these geographical restrictions will be managed. Space X <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Jv5H6FWtjQo?si=JIVOIsd-eVPy4Xpm&amp;t=1759">  some international use will be possible</a>, but only in countries where it has partners. It appears that once the company gains permission to operate in one country through a partner, it will make service available to all users visiting that country. At this time, it seems impossible to imagine that either of North Korea’s two cellular networks would ever sign up for this service.</p>
<p>How the service will be disabled in other countries is unclear, but it could be tied into the GPS location of the phone, or the satellites could refuse access when overflying unlicensed countries.</p>
<p>AST SpaceMobile has not disclosed details about planned service and via email to comment on its plans.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p><strong>Sanctions</strong></p>
<p>In the case of North Korea, the complex web of US and international sanctions also makes it unlikely a satellite communications company would want to deal with the risk of servicing North Korea.</p>
<p>However, the possibility should not be fully ruled out.</p>
<p>In early 2022, Starlink quickly turned on service in Ukraine after the government requested the satellite Internet service following the Russian invasion. That situation is different because Ukraine was not under sanctions and the Ukrainian government’s request came with the understanding that licensing was not an issue. The terminals and service were offered through a mixture of donations by Space X and funding from international aid organizations and governments.</p>
<p>The North Korean government is unlikely to make a similar request, but it is possible that service could be made available quietly, perhaps as part of a humanitarian or information freedom campaign.</p>
<p>Both services have a high potential for eventually opening new information pathways into North Korea, especially though uncensored Internet access, if and when these legal and logistical challenges can be sorted out.</p>
<p><strong>China’s Service</strong></p>
<p>One additional service that shows promise is China’s first direct-to-phone commercial satellite service, launched in September this year by China Telecom. It uses China’s Tiantong-1 (天通一号) satellite system and is a bit more like a conventional satellite phone in that it requires support to be built into a phone. That means it will not work on existing smartphones, but a handset to offer the service was recently launched.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://consumer.huawei.com/cn/phones/mate60-pro/">Huawei Mate 60 Pro</a> smartphone, launched in September, is the first phone to support this new service and China Telecom is selling service for between 200 yuan and 500 yuan ($27 to $68 USD) per month for between 50 minutes and 200 minutes of calls respectively.</p>

A Huawei graphic illustrating satellite communications on the new Mate 60 Pro smartphone (Source: Huawei).</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Chinese system is not global, but the satellite covers neighboring countries including North Korea, according to this coverage map. It is unclear if there are geographical restrictions on its use.</p>
<figure id="attachment_29047" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-29047" style="width: 467px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.38north.org/fig4-sat-to-cell-23-1020/"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-29047" src="https://www.38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Fig4-Sat-to-cell-23-1020.jpg" alt="" width="467" height="309" srcset="https://www.38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Fig4-Sat-to-cell-23-1020.jpg 467w, https://www.38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Fig4-Sat-to-cell-23-1020-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-29047" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 4. Coverage by the Tiantong1-01, 02 and 03 satellites in East and Southeast Asia (Source: Hebei Eaglefly).</figcaption></figure>
<p>It also appears to be restricted to voice and text messaging, making it slightly less useful than the other new services promise to be, but when dealing with such heavy restrictions as those placed on North Koreans, any step forward is welcome.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Radio waves have long been a preferable way to break the North Korean information blockade as they travel silently across the border and cover the entire country. That’s one of the main reasons why shortwave radio broadcasting is still an effective way of providing citizens with outside information.</p>
<p>Satellite technology is one of the best ways to offer two-way communication and Internet access across the entire country, but existing services are expensive and slow. Launching a new satellite platform is far outside the budget of information freedom campaigns.</p>
<p>Therefore, the new platforms are attractive. They solve all of the expensive technical problems with delivering a high-speed Internet signal, but as commercial services their use will initially be hampered by regulations and laws. However, as they develop, the systems are certainly worth watching as they could provide one of the biggest leaps in information access for North Koreans in decades.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recent commercial satellite imagery of North Korea’s Sohae Satellite Launching Station shows continued construction and expansion activities continue around both the main complex and coastal areas, making progress against the plans <a href="https://www.38north.org/2022/09/sohae-satellite-launch-station-site-upgrades-begin-in-earnest/">directed by Kim Jong Un</a> more than 18 months ago. Since May, North Korea has tried two times to launch a new military reconnaissance satellite into orbit. Although both attempts failed, the rapid succession of launches underscores the urgency Kim has placed on the satellite program and the heightened importance of the Sohae complex.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://kcnawatch.org/newstream/1692945199-109171186/kcna-report-on-accident-in-second-launch-of-military-reconnaissance-satellite/">third satellite launch attempt</a> is expected sometime this month. No signs of launch preparations are observed in the latest imagery; however, no signatures were obvious leading up to the previous two launches either. For both previous satellite launch attempts, North Korea <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-korea-informs-imo-satellite-launch-between-may-31-june-11-2023-05-30/">notified</a> the international community several days in advance of its plans, although it <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20230601001500325">faced critici</a><a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20230601001500325">sm</a> for not following proper procedures. No new notifications have yet been made. Should Pyongyang follow the same pattern for this new launch, it is presumably still at least several days away.</p>

<p><strong>Coastal Launch Pad</strong></p>
<p>The new coastal launch pad, <a href="https://www.38north.org/2023/05/sohae-satellite-launching-station-the-march-to-complete-the-new-coastal-launch-pad-advancing-at-a-rapid-pace/">rapidly constructed and completed in late May</a>, was used for the previous two satellite launch attempts. After the failed launch in late August, the large retractable shelter, which covers almost half of the pad, was pulled back in early September revealing the strongback launching mechanism covered with blue protective sheeting. Alongside it, construction work or possibly repair work appeared to be taking place.</p>
<p>The retractable shelter was moved back into place sometime between the morning of September 8 and the afternoon of September 9 where it has remained. Because the shelter covers the strongback launching mechanism, it is impossible to monitor the arrival of the launch vehicle or other launch preparations.</p>

<p><strong>Coastal Roadway</strong></p>
<p>South of the coastal launch pad, a new road spur is under construction coming off the new coastal roadway and extends eastward, terminating near the sea in a forested area. Its purpose is unclear though it is likely to service a yet-to-be built launch-related facility, and thus merits monitoring.</p>
<p>The latest image provides a new view of the probable inspection station located just before the coastal launch pad and <a href="https://www.38north.org/2023/07/sohae-satellite-launching-station-modernization-status-2/">highlighted</a> in our last analysis. In the latest image, what had appeared to be two white painted strips at the sides can now be clearly viewed and seems to have some height, as evidenced by the sun shadow.  The center white strip, however, appears to be flush with the pavement suggesting it is a road marking. The purpose of the station is unclear, but it could hold scanning equipment and/or a vehicle scale.</p>

<p><strong>Main Launch Pad</strong></p>
<p>At the main launch pad, planking has been applied to a retractable ramp that leads from the assembly building to the rail-mounted transfer structure. The ramp, <a href="https://www.38north.org/2023/07/sohae-satellite-launching-station-modernization-status-2/">first observed in late June</a>, can be articulated diagonally, apparently to better facilitate component transfers. The transfer structure has remained in view since June.</p>
<p>Nearby, construction continues at a slow pace on what appears to be two bunkered oxidizer and fuel storage buildings.</p>

<p><strong>Tunnel Area</strong></p>
<p>Work continues on the road tunnel that links the new probable assembly and storage building inside the secure Sohae compound to the coastal road. Multiple personnel and vehicles are visible at both tunnel entrances.</p>
<p>At the East Tunnel entrance, the road has been connected to the freshly-paved coastal road, but the tunnel road has yet to be paved. At the West Tunnel entrance, work continues on the road which will connect to the suspected new assembly and storage building and main, north-south launch station road.</p>
<p>At the probable new assembly and storage building, roofing or flooring for a second story was installed in August over the smaller rooms that run the length of the north side of the building. In addition, drainage pipes were laid by July 5, and by July 18, concrete blocks were being installed over the pipes, presumably so water can pass below where a road will likely connect the tunnel to the new building and the rest of the Sohae complex.</p>
<p>At the old Horizontal Assembly Building, in the courtyard on its southeast side, 12 blue cylindrical storage tanks had arrived by July 18 and have remained stored there since. Their final destination within the complex is unknown. They are of the same size and appearance as those at the new logistics support facility located on the east side of the complex, just off the coastal roadway.</p>

<p><strong>Vertical Engine Test Stand</strong></p>
<p>In mid-July, at the Vertical Engine Test Stand (VETS), two vehicles were observed on the apron and two additional trucks and a mobile crane were observed in the bunkered support area. In addition, all vegetation had been cleared from below the flame exhaust bucket, suggesting a pending engine test, or that one had just been completed.</p>
<p>At the observation and tracking station located on a mountain side overlooking the VETS, a probable radome, parabolic tracking dish, and a truck were observed on July 18. On August 1, the radome had been mounted on top of the tracking station, and presumably, the dish is now located inside the dome.</p>
<p>In August, the road extension to the possible missile silo area was partially paved.</p>

<p><strong>Southern Seaport</strong></p>
<p>Work is also continuing at the new seaport, located at the southeast end of the Sohae peninsula. Additional large concrete blocks have been moved into place, presumably to form the base for a berthing quay. Because the daily tides affect access to the new quay, barges and floating cranes can approach shore for only a limited periods each day. It is assumed that once the quay is completed, dredging operations will begin to ensure that vessels can enter the port regardless of the tides.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, South Korea’s President Yoon Suk-Yeol said his country could <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/why-south-korea-s-president-is-talking-about-nuclear-weapons/6919962.html">build</a> nuclear weapons if the security situation with North Korea continues to get worse. Amid increased weapons testing by North Korea, his statement was the first time this option has been discussed at the presidential level and is one of the most direct references to Seoul’s growing consideration of a nuclear future. Yoon’s remarks were unprecedented and spoke to the <a href="https://thebulletin.org/2019/10/dont-be-surprised-when-south-korea-wants-nuclear-weapons/">strong</a> public sentiment in favor of South Korea having independent nuclear forces. That said, studies <a href="https://globalaffairs.org/research/public-opinion-survey/thinking-nuclear-south-korean-attitudes-nuclear-weapons">show</a> that South Koreans are also confident that the United States will make good on its nuclear commitments, which undergird its alliance with South Korea. Moreover, South Korean officials <a href="https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2023-03/news/south-korea-walks-back-nuclear-weapons-comments">walked back</a> Yoon’s comments, arguing that, if necessary, US nuclear weapons can be used against North Korea.</p>
<p>Moreover, months after Yoon expressed these views, South Korea signed the <a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/washington-declaration-expanding-nuclear-dimension-us-south-korean-alliance-response">Washington Declaration,</a> reiterating full confidence in US extended deterrence and recommitting to its own commitments under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. This renewed impetus and goodwill in Seoul-Washington ties can be gleaned from Yoon’s characterization of his country’s alliance with Washington as a nuclear-based one.</p>
<p>It should be clear that Seoul has not made any decision to go down the nuclear path. However, the changing nuclearization debate in South Korea is important and needs to be parsed. If Seoul were to become a nuclear state, a Pyongyang-Seoul nuclear dyad would emerge on the Korean Peninsula. Such a dyadic relationship, much like the one between nuclear rivals in Pakistan and India, could be acrimonious and volatile.</p>
<p>With South Korea linking the potential acquisition of nuclear weapons to the security threats it faces from North Korea, it is instructive to look at how the South Asian nuclear dyad has fared over the past 25 years. From this,  two concomitant lessons for South Korea emerge. First, nuclear weapons will not have a revolutionary effect on the peninsula, as the security dilemma is likely to increase, not decrease, between the two Koreas. Second, while the acquisition of nuclear weapons might deter North Korea from reunifying the two Koreas by use of force, it will not outlaw destabilizing actions with nuclear undertones by both sides.</p>
<p><strong>No Nuclear Revolution in Sight</strong></p>
<p>One of the foremost lessons South Korea should draw from the India-Pakistan nuclear dyad is that the possession of nuclear weapons will not eliminate the security dilemma on the Korean Peninsula. The security dilemma, wherein a more secure South Korea instills insecurity concerns in North Korea, will remain a significant and enduring phenomenon. In other words, the theory of the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10736700.2021.1996683?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true&amp;role=tab&amp;aria-labelledby=full-article">nuclear revolution</a>, which suggests that veritable mutual vulnerability will stabilize nuclear rivalries, may not hold for the two Koreas.</p>
<p>Certainly, the South Asian nuclear equation speaks compellingly to the inherent flaws in this theory. In an <a href="https://www.stimson.org/event/nuclearization-debates-what-can-south-korea-learn-from-south-asia/">event</a> hosted by the Stimson Center, the speakers discussed how both Pakistan and India sought to obtain greater stability through nuclear weapons; however, this has not been the case. Despite completing their nuclear deterrents, their relations have been far from stable. Crises and near-crises have been prominent features in South Asia. From the 1999 <a href="https://southasianvoices.org/understanding-kargil-nuclear-factor-lessons-for-future-crises/">Kargil</a> Conflict to the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1468744/lessons-from-the-brink">2019 Pulwama-Balakot Crisis</a>, nuclear-tinged crises between the two countries have become more dangerous, complex, and difficult to manage. In fact, the proclivity to use force, especially in India, has increased over the years, despite both adversaries having nuclear weapons. This is evidenced by how the Pulwama-Balakot Crisis panned out, with India launching <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-47379558">airstrikes</a> on mainland Pakistan.</p>
<p>None of what has happened in South Asia after its overt nuclearization can be explained by the theory of nuclear revolution. If anything, since 1998, efforts have been made to increase space for <a href="https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/bitstream/handle/document/52086/ssoar-indrastraglobal-2017-6-mishra-Pakistans_Nuclear_Threshold_Not_as.pdf?sequence=1">limited wars</a> to occur at the lower end of the conflict spectrum. India’s highly touted <a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/cold-start-hot-wars-indian-armys-new-limited-war-doctrine">Cold Start Doctrine</a> (CSD), which aims at not only launching quick and deep strikes on Pakistani cities, but also causing attrition to its armed forces, was perceived as an effort to explore a range of kinetic options below the nuclear threshold. If the nuclear revolution theory held in South Asia, this space below the nuclear threshold would not have been exploited.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/beyond-us-credibility-concerns-factors-driving-nuclear-weapons-debate-south-korea">Debates</a> inside South Korea suggest a strong belief that obtaining nuclear weapons to balance out North Korea’s nuclear capabilities will deter the outbreak of crises on the Korean Peninsula. However, given India and Pakistan’s experience as a nuclear dyad, nuclear weapons can actually make both countries more belligerent and amenable to using force under a nuclear overhang.</p>
<p>To North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong Un, a nuclear-armed South Korea will make his regime’s use of force against the latter more costly. Kim would likely be uneasy with the potential emergence of mutual vulnerabilities stemming from the South’s nuclearization. It must be stressed that this type of situation may cause him to take actions that may increase the risks and chances of escalation. South Korea, for its part, might also feel emboldened and secure to the point where it could find North Korea’s conventional superiority easier to navigate. Moreover, North Korea is likely to use a South Korean nuclear arsenal as a pretext to further expand and modernize its own arsenals, exacerbating the nuclear arms race on the peninsula.</p>
<p><strong>Nuclear Weapons: A Deterrent for Reunification?</strong></p>
<p>If South Korea goes nuclear, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/09/15/1191126701/south-korea-unification-ministry-north-korea-defectors">reunifying</a> the two Koreas through the use of force will become an extremely dangerous proposition. This is primarily because mutual vulnerabilities will set in and have a deterrent effect on both Seoul and Pyongyang. To better understand this dynamic, looking at the example of India and Pakistan is necessary. While the addition of nuclear weapons to South Asia’s security mix has not stabilized India-Pakistan relations, it has deterred full-scale conventional wars between the two rivals. Further, the presence of nuclear weapons has affected changes in the crisis behaviors of both India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>Since 1998, when India and Pakistan went overtly nuclear, the way both countries responded to crises has been notably more limited than before they were in possession of nuclear weapons. For example, India’s response to Pakistan in <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/2017/11/20/nuclear-stability-conventional-instability-north-korea-and-lessons-from-pakistan-pub-74787">Kargil</a> was limited and less escalatory than its retaliation to the latter’s kinetic operations in the Indo-Pak War of 1965. Similarly, Pakistan’s response to India’s air attack on Balakot in 2019 was driven by the need to show <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1466364">restraint</a>. This is evidenced by the fact that Pakistan’s retaliatory strikes were not directed against any <a href="https://dailytimes.com.pk/892466/pafs-operation-swift-retort-feb-27-continues-to-haunt-iaf/">military</a> or civilian targets. Moreover, territories have not changed hands, nor have large-scale operations been witnessed between the two countries since they went nuclear.</p>
<p>All this makes it abundantly clear that, under a nuclear overhang, the use of force can only do so much when it comes to revising the territorial status quo. Indeed, neither India nor Pakistan can militarily solve its festering dispute over Kashmir without risking a nuclear exchange. This is one of the reasons why India’s <a href="https://southasianvoices.org/understanding-the-political-impact-of-indias-removal-of-jammu-kashmirs-special-status/">revocation</a> of Kashmir’s special status in 2019 did not lead to a military confrontation between the two countries.</p>
<p>The continuation of this de facto status quo in Kashmir is the only part of the nuclear revolution theory that applies to South Asia. That said, whether or not it remains intact going forward is an important question that currently has no definite answer. While India’s government has vowed to wrest back territories from Pakistan, doing so could prove to be suicidal, given that the latter has a robust nuclear deterrent in its armory. The same is likely to be the case on the peninsula. As previously mentioned, Pyongyang’s freedom of action may be curtailed if Seoul bares its teeth, thereby making it harder for the former to forcibly reunify the peninsula. The same would also apply to a strengthened, confident and independently nuclear South Korea. The Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and the Line of Control (LoC), which partitions the disputed Kashmir region between India and Pakistan, both present formidable challenges. Pushing back against the DMZ can be as demanding as pushing back against the LoC.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>As demonstrated by South Asia’s experiences with India and Pakistan, the possession of nuclear weapons by the two rivals has not attenuated their security dilemma. In some cases, nuclear weapons have encouraged both sides to engage in low-level conflict, while in others, they have led to some level of restraint in the application of force. On balance, the nuclearization of South Asia has prevented territorial grabs from both sides, as evidenced by how all the post-1998 crises terminated without any revisions in territory.</p>
<p>Hence, if South Korea chooses to develop nuclear weapons, it could potentially serve as a deterrent against a large-scale conflict with North Korea. It is crucial, however, to recognize that the acquisition of nuclear weapons by South Korea will not diminish the complexity posed by Kim Jong Un. This is primarily due to his persistent efforts to leverage vulnerabilities in his favor while maintaining the delicate balance of power.</p>
<p>Also, acquiring nuclear weapons may result in the elimination of Washington’s extended deterrence, leaving Seoul to deal with Pyongyang on its own. While strengthening bilateral crisis management mechanisms is important, a lot of effort will be needed for both Koreas to terminate any kind of nuclear-laden crises on their own. It is possible that both sides might be more risk-acceptant. For example, they could, like India and Pakistan, look to find spaces for brinkmanship, something that could lead to miscalculations. This is primarily because, like the Kashmir conflict, the issue of Korea’s reunification will continue to play on the minds of leaders in Seoul and Pyongyang. And, as in the case of South Asia, unresolved conflicts will continue birthing crisis triggers. It may also cost Seoul its alliance with Washington altogether, which would have a whole different set of implications for South Korea’s security. This prospect of South Korea going nuclear could also trigger significant concern from another regional heavyweight, Japan. This is especially true considering Japan’s staunch commitment to nuclear nonproliferation. Consequently, these developments have the potential to give rise to increased tensions within the region, albeit likely only in the short term. It can, therefore, be argued that there is no guarantee that a nuclear dyad would improve the security situation on the Korean peninsula and is unlikely to help maintain stability there.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recent commercial satellite imagery indicates an uptick in vehicular activity on the New Yalu River Bridge between China and North Korea this week. The <a href="https://apnews.com/b469830b42e945899fffea642ed70dce/chinas-350m-bridge-gets-scant-n-korean-welcome">US$350-million</a> cable-stayed bridge was completed in 2014 and is supposed to be a major new crossing point for Sino-North Korean trade, but it has remained unused, earning it the nickname “the bridge to nowhere.”</p>
<p>The exact nature and purpose of this traffic is uncertain, but comes after increased activity around the Chinese side of the bridge and <a href="https://www.nknews.org/pro/largest-north-korea-china-bridge-may-be-preparing-for-grand-opening/">suggestions it may fully open</a> soon.</p>

<p><strong>Activity at the “Bridge to Nowhere”</strong></p>
<p>A satellite image captured on October 12 shows what appears to be a large vehicle, possibly a coach, approaching the Chinese customs area on the Chinese side of the bridge.</p>

<p>After the bridge was completed in 2014, construction of related infrastructure on both sides has moved ahead in small steps. Although the nature of the traffic and its eventual destination cannot be determined from the October 12 image, the level of traffic, while low, is unusual for a bridge that has seen no use in years.</p>
<p>When it was first built, the North Korean side of the bridge abruptly ended in a field, but work to connect it to Sinuiju City and the North Korean road network <a href="https://www.38north.org/2020/05/sinuiju052920/">was completed around 2020</a>. At the same time, it appeared North Korea was also beginning construction of a likely customs and immigration area, but work on that stopped in late 2020 and has not restarted.</p>
<p><strong>Chinese Customs and Immigration Area </strong></p>
<p>On the Chinese side, the unfinished customs and immigration area <a href="https://www.38north.org/2023/05/recent-chinese-construction-suggests-expectations-for-broader-trade/">was completed earlier this year</a> with control barriers and checkpoints.</p>
<p>In the October 12 image, the Chinese customs area appears quiet, with no vehicles visible.</p>

<p><strong>Lingering Questions</strong></p>
<p>Transit of goods between North Korea and China has been rising for the last year since pandemic-era border restrictions began to be loosened. To date, rail and sea have been used for the majority of cargo shipments, and a smaller amount has been spotted coming by air.</p>
<p>Truck traffic, which used the older Sino-Korean Friendship Bridge in Sinuiju, does not appear to have resumed.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, North Korea has also begun repatriating its citizens who were stuck overseas for most of the pandemic. Some <a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/korea/china-repatriates-north-korean-defectors-10122023004404.html">reports</a> said they could enter through Sinuiju.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative Approaches and Methodologies to Conducting Fieldwork</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Asymmetry of Relations</em></strong></p>
<p>Classical anthropology was defined by its relationship to otherness, including spatial otherness, vis-à-vis its object of research.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> The post-structuralist approach from the 1970s onwards made the problem more complex: in order to be able to deconstruct the unconscious and systemic biases around the human object studied, it became necessary to restore its status as a subject. This then requires having to come up with and define another relationship to the otherness of the scientific field.</p>
<p>The temptation to turn “the North Koreans” into an absolute and irreconcilable “other” is always strong. Certainly, there are different types of asymmetries between our North Korean interlocutors and ourselves from an economic, scientific, informational point of view, etc. Many do not have the ability to properly understand us or our behaviors due to reasons such as not having access to external information or being able to travel abroad. Sometimes, the communication between us and our North Korean colleagues can come across as alienating asymmetry, especially since this inequality can even become a strategy to limit our demands while monetizing even the slightest favors.</p>
<p>During our last collective fieldwork in 2018, we conducted an experimental seminar by applying a participatory activity that was both ideologically safe for our North Korean partners and extremely valuable in lessons. After giving a presentation on the investigative technique of mental maps and its contribution to urban design and planning, we asked our colleagues and the students at Pyongyang University of Architecture to make some with us. This new experience was carried out with obvious pleasure and made it possible to collect through the drawings valuable information on their representations of and their way of living and/or developing the city while exchanging our own images. This was more instructive than the exchanges we had been able to have in more traditional workshops because the drawings were spontaneous.</p>
<p>Furthermore, drawing can be viewed as less politically engaging and, therefore, less dangerous than speech. We were able to use this experiment as a form of disruptive investigation (aka “breaching”) to bring out meaning in a style of communication that is not restricted by official discourse codes.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> From this experience, we were able to come up with alternative, participatory or co-creative and non-verbal methods of inquiry, where we ourselves can intervene to reduce the asymmetry.</p>
<p>Another action was inviting our North Korean colleagues to Paris for a week of field visits and a scientific workshop around a common theme in 2017 and 2019. Architectural field visits often result in being able to better explain what is happening in one place (<em>here</em>), to ask questions and, therefore, better understand how things work somewhere else (<em>there</em>): for example, discussing the water supply in Paris with North Korean colleagues lead naturally to compare and talk about how it works in Pyongyang. In some respects, our fieldwork of Pyongyang was also conducted in Paris, revealing that fieldwork can be “multi-sited.”<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>The combination of all these actions has formed the basis of our method of scientific engagement, based on contact with peers, mutual respect and common research interests, which is the only kind that is valid in a closed field of this type.</p>
<p><strong><em>The “Power”—a Nebulous Other</em></strong></p>
<p>However, there remains another that is far more absolute and elusive than all the people we met; it is the nebulous force of the “power,” or the “organs,” as Michel Gentile defines it, whose hidden dynamics are sometimes revealed to us.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> For example, one day, our guides ended up letting us walk around and document an apartment courtyard in Pyongyang, where the daily life of the locals is observable. The next day, the guides told us they had problems with their hierarchy because a resident had called the agency in charge of security to complain about strangers intruding. Thus, our guides, who supposedly represent this Power, were called to order by the exact same Power, demonstrating the difficulty of their role as mediators between us and those in control.</p>
<p>The fieldwork cannot exist if the other is objectified more than objectivized. Even though human interaction is often denied in the DPRK, it does take place, if only with our colleagues and guides.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> All of this confirms once again that the field is not raw data but a co-construction between researchers, workers in the field, observers and mediators.</p>
<p><strong>Translating the Field: Writing the Social Sciences in a New Way</strong></p>
<p>Our book also questions the classical protocols of social science research, particularly the production of academic materials, by using a device generally banned from scientific discourse—humor. The distancing necessary for our being able to reflect upon theoretical assumptions and perspectives, along with the psychological pressures experienced in a difficult terrain, requires the use of alternative practices of discourse. Irony can serve as an effective tool as it is a form of both distancing and questioning.</p>
<p>Similarly, we chose to apply decentering and distancing treatments to the illustrations in the <a href="http://www.atelierdescahiers.com/faireduterrainencoreedunord.html">book</a>. We asked Sun Mu, a North Korean visual artist now living in South Korea, to transform our field photographs into drawings.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> He also created comics out of some of our anecdotes in the field based on our notes. This patchwork of text and images is like collected fragments of interpretation that could be viewed as hypotheses posited in relation to the totalitarian temptation created by a political regime that organizes, informs, and controls fieldwork in North Korea.</p>
<p>Thus, our book presents itself as a type of fieldwork manifesto that tries to convey the complexity of our research while also demonstrating our determined desire to gain a greater understanding of North Korean realities, despite the difficulties.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: Scientific and Ethical Integrity</strong></p>
<p>Despite any successes we may have encountered over the years, there remains a major difficulty in organizing fieldwork trips to North Korea—ethics.</p>
<p>We have seen that the surveillance of the individuals in contact with the researcher is an issue. It is not only about the research and its use, but also the risks that we may cause our informants to take or the fact that the people we are in contact with may be the subject of investigations, which always carries uncertain consequences.</p>
<p>The difficulty of how to maintain neutrality is another ethical issue.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> Faced with an emotionally harsh reality but engaged in their research and faithful to long-term personal relationships with their local guides and colleagues and their individual values, researchers may be tempted to ignore the injunction of neutrality that their profession dictates and put themselves in danger in closed or even violent fields.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a> To attempt to penetrate North Korea, where the researcher is directly confronted with the violence of the system, even if only in a hushed way, is also to take the risk of being made a tool of the totalitarian system. However, avoiding the country contributes to its isolation, confinement and the making of this “anti-world,” which certainly plays into the hands of the North Korean system.</p>
<p>Fieldwork in the DPRK is by no means this romantic, naïve and positivist idea of a reality to be discovered but is quite literally–a <em>field to work</em>. It is a complex process that is inscribed in temporality. It is a process that fully engages the researcher as a person. There is no doubt that it is increasingly urgent and necessary to continue conducting fieldwork in North Korea.</p>
<p>Like all countries in the world, North Korea reacted to the pandemic by increasing control over its population in an extreme manner. The country remained closed for more than three years, which affected our contacts and our ability to conduct fieldwork. As with our scientific partners in other countries, we have tried to keep in touch despite the distance (we ran a remote workshop on December 6 and 7, 2022), and, as elsewhere, we hope that the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/09/05/north-korea-covid-reopening/">reopening</a> of the country will enable a gradual return to normal. In this context, on the basis of the “field to work” initiated more than fifteen years ago (2006) at the Centre for Korean Studies of EHESS, we intend to resume our engaged projects as soon as possible.</p>

All of which contribute to North Korea being demonized in the West.</p>
<p>In the book <em>Faire du terrain en Corée du Nord </em>(Doing Fieldwork in North Korea), which was the result of fieldwork carried out in the fall of 2013 by a team of seven European researchers, we share our experiences and knowledge about North Korea, to offer a different perspective of the academic research on the country. Based on this book, this series of two articles proposes a summary of this different approach based on our skills as specialists in Korean studies who conduct Korean-language fieldwork in North Korea and are scientifically engaged in research about the two Koreas. We have traveled to the DPRK several times for more than a decade, built direct contacts there, and some members of our research team have conducted numerous projects in the country.</p>
<p>In the context of a “closed field” for social sciences, where ethnographic investigation is almost impossible, it is logical to wonder what kind of scientific research can be conducted in a totalitarian country.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> This first article will examine fieldwork in North Korea from an academic perspective as well as the limitations and specific problems associated with it. Alternative approaches and methodologies for conducting fieldwork will be explored in the second article.</p>
<p><strong>How to do Scientific Fieldwork in North Korea</strong>–<strong>the Scholarly Context</strong></p>
<p>For more than twenty years, anthropologists and ethnologists have adopted critical approaches to their objects, as doing fieldwork is never objective or transparent. It has been demonstrated that the facts collected <em>there</em>, even the most seemingly neutral ones, are always reconstructions and interpretations, and what one may take from them is most likely to be discovered in the interstitial spaces and/or detours between these facts.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, conducting fieldwork in the DPRK remains stuck in a kind of scientific limbo, as it is traditional wisdom that doing so is impossible in this country. The announcement that one is preparing to conduct fieldwork in North Korea can invoke jaded comments like: “We know perfectly well what there is to see there—what ‘they’ want us to see and nothing else.” However, there is not so much an actual “reality” to see or discover in North Korea; rather, only social processes to be deciphered. In short, one of North Korea’s particularities is to reduce our work to a form of positivism that sets back social sciences to infancy before the development of critical analysis.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>It is true that the DPRK does not easily comply with the conditions of a <em>fieldwork pact</em> as described by the French geographer Yann Calbérac. After all, how can one establish the elements of a fieldwork pact when one lacks the freedom to implement fieldwork?<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> If “the issues at stake in drawing upon fieldwork are to generate belief in the veracity of on-the-ground observations and simultaneously vouch for the arguments that are presented as following from them,” how can fieldwork be conducted in a country that the French journalist Philippe Grangereau has <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1516566/?ref_=nm_knf_c_2">called</a> the “Country of the Big Lie”?<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p><strong><em>North Korea, a Difficult Field in a Closed Context</em></strong></p>
<p>The DPRK falls under the category of a “difficult and closed” field in the social sciences.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> North Korea and Kazakhstan, prisons in any democracy, together with numerous other spaces characterized by surveillance and restricted movement for researchers, are characteristically labeled as “closed contexts.” Despite the rich literature that exists on this subject matter, the question as to why contemporary research on the DPRK has not advanced beyond observing the challenges of accessing material and the unreliability of sources remains. Valérie Gelézeau examines how academic and media discourse regarding North Korea reflects a process whereby that country is Orientalized and confined to North Korea versus South Korea.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> However, these binary modes of discussion are entirely in keeping with the official, outside pronouncements of the North Korean regime. All of which contribute to the placement of methodological limitations on research on the DPRK.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>The point is not to render these challenging fields as “exceptional” but rather to analyze different types of fieldwork situations to identify common modalities of context. Doing so maintains the possibility of developing common methods for approaching and interpreting fieldwork in a “closed context.”</p>
<p><strong><em>Taking a Critical Approach to Fieldwork Situations</em></strong></p>
<p>As such, we adopted the critical perspective of a fieldwork situation in a closed context to interpret our studies in North Korea by considering the following three aspects of these scholarly undertakings:</p>
<ol>
<li>The policy for preparing fieldwork and developing the program before departing for the field;</li>
<li>Fieldwork practice on-site, when the researchers are confronted with the surveillance from what M. Gentile calls “the organs,” i.e., the North Korean regime;<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></li>
<li>The problem of translating this type of scholarly exploration into text (i.e., an article, report or book).</li>
</ol>
<p>These three fundamental elements are at the core of our book and are meant to expose the conditions under which research is carried out. For example, the stratagems around the status of the illustrations in the book raise the question: “Do our trips to the DPRK qualify as fieldwork?”</p>
<p>If one views fieldwork from a simplistic, experience-based perspective as a discovery to be presented, then the answer to the question above is “No.” However, if one sees fieldwork as a researcher-constructed space with a set of networks and as a process that allows for an ever-developing space of discussion regarding the issues that are brought up, then the answer is “Yes.” Conducting fieldwork in North Korea raises the following topics: being unable to freely conduct research, disinformation or non-information, a fetishist focus on the scopic dimension, surveillance, and interpreting what one observes on-site. All of these are problems familiar to scholars who worked in the former Soviet Union or pre-reform China. Fieldwork in North Korea is a process, a <em>field to work.</em></p>
<p><strong>Doing Fieldwork in North Korea: Specific Problems and Limitations</strong></p>
<p>When surveillance, the unreliability of statistical sources and the fact that, apart from the official documents, one has limited access to things are all part of the environment, the dilemma of how one is supposed to organize their fieldwork is very real.</p>
<p>As shared in our book, we developed a fundamental method of scientific engagement, which consists of working in the field with the long-term North Korean colleagues who accompany us there and with whom we share our scientific interests. Our themes of the city, architecture and urban planning in both Koreas are subjects on which the Centre for Korean Studies of the École des hautes études en sciences sociales (School of Advanced Studies in Social Sciences, or EHESS, the project leader institution) has more than thirty years of expertise. As anthropologists, geographers, historians, archaeologists, architects, and specialists in literature or visual studies who have been working on Korean cities for years, our observations of North Korean cities are always implemented during our pre-negotiated, on-site visits, seminars and workshops with our partners.</p>
<p>Our research projects evolve according to our previous fields, which then helps us redirect our research toward more feasible subjects. For instance, following two general presentations on urban agriculture in 2018 at Pyongyang University of Architecture, Benjamin Joinau, one of this article’s authors, noted his North Korean colleagues’ interest in this topic and observed its implementation in Pyongyang. This is how he decided to create a field project to study this aspect of Pyongyang’s public spaces.</p>
<p><strong><em>Visibility Regimes</em></strong></p>
<p>According to B. Joinau, access to the visibility of urban spaces in North Korea depends on variable factors for the same agent, depending on the context of the visit.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a> Therefore, in this analysis, visibility regimes include whether one is visible in a public or private space and if having access to seeing sites, phenomena and/or people is possible. The distance between the object and the spectator, and between the spectators themselves, all factor into this social distinction as well.</p>
<p>Pyongyang’s highly planned monumentality, for instance, establishes strong distances between the monument and the spectator that tend to focus on the visual, physical inscription in space. For foreign visitors, vision tends to be the most excited sense, to the detriment of doing and speaking<em>.</em> This scopic saturation can be particularly anxiety-provoking, and it is how being in the DPRK differs from being a part of a tourism group or going on an official trip to another country with an open context.</p>
<p><strong><em>Scopic Saturation, Sensory Fatigue and Overinterpretation</em></strong></p>
<p>The impossibility of doing anything on an official visit to North Korea outside of sleeping can produce a harmful intensity. Your time is completely filled with no vacant period in which to recover, think or de-stress.</p>
<p>There is a type of visual fatigue that results from the aforementioned visual saturation. The research trips are generally short and expensive, meaning that their outcome must be achieved in a short period of time. This type of “concentration” often causes the visitor to overinterpret everything they see in order to obtain the information that is refused to them. For the researcher, this results in scopic exhaustion, as the eye cannot “run” aimlessly. Instead, it is forced to inspect and scrutinize everything.</p>
<p>This “hermeneutic obsession,” or pressure to find meaning in every phenomenon, is exhausting and leads to many mistakes, especially when the researcher’s capacities for contextualization and interpretation are insufficient.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a> Hence, the question of how a foreign researcher should acquire enough first-hand evidence and concrete, informative elements when access to the field is denied to them very much exists. While we will not get into it here, this paradox can be overcome in many cases depending on the methods specific to each discipline.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a> One way to acquire elements of comparison within the framework of traditional cultural practices can be to gain familiarization on the same field in South Korea, as the cultural “commons” specific to the two countries has not been completely erased. Our time in the Republic of Korea (ROK) as in the DPRK has always allowed us to glean something instructive, and we always leave having learned more about how to see.</p>
<p><strong><em>Surveillance and Interpretation</em></strong></p>
<p>In addition to always being accompanied when in the DPRK, surveillance comes with other more significant issues. The “minders” assigned to us are also people we can learn a lot from and with whom we can discuss what we are seeing and experiencing. This is especially true after repeated contact when they become—as is the case now for us—our colleagues rather than just minders. Given our shared experiences, we have built projects and can carry on scientific discussions with them. However, this situation can result in a classic form of interpretive bias that can confuse the trip’s framework or one’s personal experience of the surveillance. As was the case in the former USSR, North Koreans who are in contact with foreigners are subjected to surveillance themselves—they are briefed and debriefed before and after encounters with us. Moreover, our behavior can also have an adverse impact on the person accompanying us, making us mindful of how we interact with them as well. Thus, the situation we experience on the ground does not actually tell us much about North Korean society.</p>
<p>This brings us back to the question of the interpretation of observed facts. If everything is taken to be a lie, how can one explain a given fact? Is one to assume that the riders of the Pyongyang Metro are all actors, as the geographer Caroll Medlicott concluded?<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a> For example, how is one to interpret the presence of many evening readers sitting under streetlamps in Pyongyang in the evening? Were they rationing electricity? Did they wish to get some fresh air? Were they escaping the domestic surveillance of their spouses? What does using the street in this way mean in this city? Very often, behind these practices that we perceive as anomalies (i.e., reading in the evening under a streetlamp and not at home), we seek confirmation to questions, which, in this case, are about confirming the electricity supply problems in the capital. But the official explanation given by our North Korean guides and colleagues (readers are students looking for a quiet environment to study outside of the family apartment), who are also our informants, was done so from the context of their social reality, which is no more biased than our question. As such, it is necessary to use all the methodological resources available to the social sciences to make sense of the answers provided by our informants to explain the phenomena seen. Applying certain outdated ethnography that tended to either expect “true” explanations from informants or deny granting any value to their explanations and answer for them is no longer acceptable.</p>
<p>This first article has examined social sciences fieldwork in North Korea from an epistemological perspective as well as the limitations and specific problems associated with this “closed context.” Alternative approaches and methodologies for conducting fieldwork will be explored in the second article.<a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"></a></p>

<p>From September 12-17, Kim Jong Un made an official visit to the Russian Federation. The Democratic Republic of Korea’s (DPRK or North Korea) supreme leader’s voyage to Russia was not unexpected. The stage had already been set by Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu’s high-profile trip to Pyongyang in July. Shoigu’s visit made clear that Moscow and Pyongyang were engaged in a lively diplomatic-strategic dance. It was an American outlet, the <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/04/us/politics/putin-kim-meeting-russia-north-korea-weapons.html">New York Times</a></em>, that correctly forecasted a Russian-DPRK summit a week before it was announced.</p>
<p>Kim’s visit was clearly intended to be high-profile and spectacular. However, beyond all the theatrics, the real-life effects of the Kim-Putin summit remain to be seen. We still have more questions than answers.</p>
<p><strong>Rockets, Bombers, Ballet and a Walrus Show</strong></p>
<p>This was Kim’s second official visit to Russia. Compared to the first trip, which took place April 24-26, 2019, the voyage was both longer (six days) and more extensive in geographic coverage: in 2019, Kim just went to Vladivostok, whereas this time, his armored train traveled all the way to the Amur Region where Russia’s space center Vostochny is located. Kim’s itinerary, as well as the composition of his entourage—heavy with military and military-industrial chiefs—left little doubt that a major focus of his visit was to promote military and technological links with Russia.</p>
<p>At Vostochny, Kim held a one-day summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Russian host gave his North Korean guest a tour of the spaceport, highlighting Russia’s main space rockets, Soyuz and Angara. Then Kim proceeded to Komsomolsk-on-Amur, a major center of the defense industry. In Komsomolsk, Kim toured an aircraft plant that manufactures Russia’s Sukhoi fighters and SJ 100 passenger planes. The final leg of his tour across the Russian Far East was Vladivostok and the city’s environs, where Kim spent two full days. He visited an airbase where he was shown an array of Russia’s fighter jets and strategic bombers. The North Korean leader was also hosted aboard a guided-missile frigate. The civilian part of his stay in Vladivostok featured Kim’s attendance of “The Sleeping Beauty” ballet performance, a visit to an aquarium where Kim was treated to the show of a trained walrus, a tour of a biotechnology plant, and a visit to Far Eastern Federal University (the venue of Kim’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/putin-arrives-in-russian-far-east-ahead-of-first-ever-summit-with-kim-jong-un/2019/04/24/a2d941f8-65c6-11e9-a698-2a8f808c9cfb_story.html">2019 summit</a> with Putin), where he met with a group of North Korean youths studying at the university.</p>
<p>Not much is known about the substance of the Putin-Kim talks at Vostochny, and no joint statement or agreements were signed. However, in their public comments, Putin himself and other Russian officials made it abundantly clear that “all issues,” including possibilities for bilateral military cooperation, were <a href="https://www.interfax.ru/russia/920503">discussed</a>. The list of top Russian officials at the Vostochny summit may give some idea about the broad agenda of the talks.</p>
<p>Russia’s delegation included Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Deputy Prime Minister (in charge of Russia’s defense industries) Denis Manturov, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, Deputy Prime Minister (in charge of international trade) Alexey Overchuk, Deputy Prime Minister (in charge of the Russian Far East) Yuri (Yury) Trutnev, Deputy Prime Minister (in charge of Russia’s construction industry) Marat Khusnullin, Minister of Natural Resources and Co-chairman of the Russian-DPRK Intergovernmental Commission for Cooperation in Trade, Economy, Science and Technology Alexandr Kozlov, Minister of Transport Vitaly Saveliev (Savelyev), and the Chief of Russia’s space agency, Yuri Borisov. Kim was accompanied by Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui, Korean People’s Army Marshal Pak Jong Chon, Defense Minister Kang Sun Nam, secretaries of the Workers’ Party of Korea’s Central Committee, O Su Yong and Pak Thae Song, and Vice Foreign Minister Im Chon Il. Apart from the summit at Vostochny, Kim also held separate talks in Vladivostok—with Sergey Shoigu and then with Primorsky Region Governor Oleg Kozhemyako.</p>
<p>There were subtle differences in Moscow’s and Pyongyang’s public messaging during the visit worth noting. North Korea <a href="https://kcnawatch.org/newstream/1694661619-772350803/respected-comrade-kim-jong-un-has-talks-with-russian-president/">presented</a> it as a milestone in “strengthening strategic and tactical cooperation between the two countries and extending strong support to and solidarity with each other on the common front to frustrate the imperialists’ military threat and provocation.” Kim <a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/catalog/countries/KP/events/72265">called</a> relations with Russia Pyongyang’s “top priority.” The North Korean leader gave <a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/catalog/countries/KP/events/72266">eloquent support</a> to Russia’s “sacred struggle to punish the evil crowd, which claims the right to hegemony based on the illusion of expansionism.” He also expressed confidence that Russia will succeed in its “special military operation” in Ukraine and “when building a powerful state.” Putin was more reserved in his public statements at the summit. In contrast to Kim, he refrained from lashing out at the West’s US-led “imperialism” and “hegemonism.” Also, he never used the word “strategic” when talking about Russia-DPRK ties. Instead, Putin <a href="http://kremlin.ru/catalog/countries/KP/events/72266">characterized</a> the bilateral relationship as one of “camaraderie and good-neighborliness.”</p>
<p><strong>Russia’s Rationale</strong></p>
<p>North Korea’s <em>Korean Central News Agency</em> (<em>KCNA</em>) may not be off the mark <a href="https://kcnawatch.org/newstream/1694650131-1640637/president-putin-hosts-reception-in-welcome-of-respected-comrade-kim-jong-un/">stating</a> that “the historic meeting and talks between Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin…put the traditional and strategic DPRK-Russia friendship, cooperation and good neighborly relations on a new higher level.” What, then, are the motivations of the sides to upgrade the relationship? There are several reasons Moscow is interested in resuscitating strategic ties with the DPRK.</p>
<p>First, it should be kept in mind that North Korea is fully aligned with Russia on the Ukraine issue. Apart from Syria, Pyongyang is the only United Nations member that recognizes Crimea, as well as Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporizhzhia (Zaporozhye) and Kherson as Russian territories. The visit of a prominent foreign leader who is willing to openly defy the West and speak in support of Russia has its own value for Moscow.</p>
<p>There is little doubt that Moscow’s embrace of Pyongyang is partly a response to Seoul’s position on Ukraine. The Republic of Korea (ROK) has joined the US and European Union-led sanctions regime against Russia. Furthermore, South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol has emerged as one of the major international backers of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, complete with Yoon’s visit to Kyiv in July. Despite the ROK’s assertions that it only provides non-lethal aid to Ukraine, it is an open secret that South Korean artillery shells, officially sent to backfill US weapons depots, are highly likely to end up killing Russian troops on the Ukrainian frontlines.</p>
<p>Finally, Moscow cannot but watch with alarm the formation of an axis between Seoul and Warsaw. In particular, the ROK has become a major military-industrial partner for Poland, making huge arms and military technology deals with Warsaw. One wonders if Seoul had not been aware in advance that its growing involvement in fraught Eastern European geopolitics would trigger an inevitable payback from Moscow. Last October, Putin went on record, <a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/69695">warning</a> Seoul that South Korea’s military support to Ukraine could “ruin” its relations with Russia.</p>
<p>There are also economic calculations behind the Moscow-Pyongyang reengagement. North Korean labor in exchange for Russia’s cash and commodities like oil, grain and fertilizer is the most obvious area for commercial partnership. Russia has always been short of workers, especially in industries such as construction and agriculture—deals between Moscow and Pyongyang on supplying North Korean labor to Russia date back to the 1960s. North Korean labor exports to Russia halted in the late 2010s due to United Nations Security Council (UNSC) sanctions and then the COVID-19 pandemic. Now is a logical moment for North Korean workers to come back.</p>
<p>Another economic project the two sides may try to revive is the Khasan-Rajin rail-and-port joint venture. A decade ago, Russia completed a rail link connecting the Trans-Siberian Railway via the Russian border township of Khasan with the North Korean port of Rajin. Back then, there were hopes that Khasan-Rajin would serve as a pilot for connecting the envisioned Trans-Korean Railway with the Trans-Siberian. Those expectations didn’t come to pass. Even though Russia had sunk $300 million to construct the link and upgrade the port facilities in Rajin, the project has mostly remained idle due to South Korea’s withdrawal, tightening North Korea sanctions, and COVID-19.</p>
<p>The possibility of North Korean arms deliveries to Russia was perhaps the most intriguing aspect of Kim’s summit with Putin. On the surface of it, the proposition that the DPRK could send arms to Russia looks perfectly logical. The Ukraine war is, after all, a conflict where Russia is pitted against the combined capabilities of “the collective West.” Any military assistance would certainly be of help. Russian military bloggers are especially enthusiastic about North Korean multiple-launch rocket systems KN-09 and KN-25.</p>
<p>Since last year, US officials have been asserting North Korea was sending munitions to Russia. However, no credible evidence has been provided to back those claims except for <a href="https://www.nknews.org/2023/01/new-photos-show-north-korea-sent-weapons-to-russian-paramilitary-group-pentagon/">satellite photos</a> of a few <a href="https://www.38north.org/2022/11/first-traffic-observed-on-north-korea-russia-railway-link-in-several-years/">railcars</a> crossing from <a href="https://www.38north.org/2022/12/a-north-korean-rail-yard-near-russia-springs-to-life/">North Korea into Russia</a>. Russian sources say the train cars in question were, in reality, empty cars returning to Russia after transporting hay to the DPRK.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>If North Korean weapons made it to the frontline, it would be impossible to hide them for long, especially taking into account that the Ukraine war is probably the most closely watched and well-documented military conflict in history. If Putin and Kim made an arms deal, we should know soon. In any case, North Korean weapons, even if they do arrive in Russia, can, at best, play an auxiliary role. What matters is Russia’s own ability to maintain and ramp up domestic arms production.</p>
<p>In the same vein, despite showcasing some of Russia’s best weapons to Kim, Moscow providing arms and military or dual-use technology to the DPRK is not a foregone conclusion. It remains to be seen how quickly, how far, and on what terms Moscow is ready to proceed in military-technical cooperation with the DPRK.</p>
<p>Any substantial cooperation with the DPRK, be it in civilian or military areas, would inevitably clash with the UNSC-mandated sanctions imposed on North Korea, for which Russia itself voted as a permanent member of the Security Council. Commenting on his summit with Kim, Putin <a href="https://tass.ru/politika/18758633">said</a> Russia continues to comply with the UN-imposed restrictions and is “not going to violate anything.” That said, a creative re-interpretation by Russia of the North Korea sanctions regime may be in order. Many in Moscow are quite explicit Russia should no longer feel bound by sanctions in dealings with North Korea. Sergey Lavrov may have hinted that much when he <a href="https://tass.ru/politika/18737709">said</a> that the sanctions against North Korea “had been adopted in an absolutely different geopolitical situation.” As the Director of the Institute of Chinese and Asian Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Kirill Babayev, <a href="https://tass.ru/ekonomika/18760783?ysclid=lmkxjw1ynt300921032">points out</a>, Russia’s support of sanctions on North Korea “used to be part of a grand bargain with the West. This bargain is now over.”</p>
<p><strong>Kim’s Calculus</strong></p>
<p>What is Kim’s game with Moscow? Pyongyang may have short-term commercial considerations, such as receiving from Russia cash, oil and food in exchange for potential supplies of labor and munitions. However, it is a long-term balance-of-power logic that may be the main driver behind Kim’s push for a closer relationship with Russia.</p>
<p>For a long time, the DPRK has basically been on its own in political-military terms. After the collapse of the Soviet Union and China’s rapprochement with South Korea in the early 1990s, North Korea had no allies. The attainment of nuclear weapons made it possible for the DPRK to feel secure—and indeed comfortable—in the situation of strategic solitude. Yet this period of assured security may be coming to an end. North Korea’s nuclear deterrent is not the eternal Ring of Power. Like all weapons, nukes are susceptible to technological change. And Pyongyang’s nuclear missiles, at best, correspond to the technological level the United States and the Soviet Union had achieved half a century ago. The DPRK faces the grave risk that its nukes may, at some future point, be trumped by new emerging weapons. There are <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/isec/article/41/4/9/12158/The-New-Era-of-Counterforce-Technological-Change">assessments</a>, of which Pyongyang is certainly aware, that we may be entering a new military-strategic era of counterforce where highly accurate weapons, coupled with remote sensing and powerful artificial intelligence (AI), make nuclear arsenals extremely vulnerable to disarming strikes.</p>
<p>North Korea’s conventional forces are no match for the combined might of the US-ROK alliance. Nukes may, for now, provide Pyongyang with a deterrent against head-on aggression, but they are useless in most other crisis scenarios. You can’t fight wars, not to mention limited conflicts, with nuclear weapons. This partly explains why Pyongyang, despite its militant rhetoric and spectacular missile launches, has been careful not to cross the line that triggers a kinetic clash with the ROK-US forces. The last major military incident on the Korean Peninsula happened in November 2010, when the North and South exchanged artillery fire. <a href="https://toyokeizai.net/articles/-/664415">According to US officials</a>, “The North Koreans…are not doing anything that moves toward conventional military confrontation.” The formation of the US-ROK-Japan coalition, epitomized by the recent trilateral summit at <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/08/18/fact-sheet-the-trilateral-leaders-summit-at-camp-david/">Camp David</a>, makes the situation even more worrying for North Korea.</p>
<p>There is no realistic way for North Korea to close the widening gap in modern warfighting capabilities with its opponents on its own. It has neither financial nor technological resources to catch up even to ROK’s conventional capabilities, let alone those of the US and Japan. The only way to redress the increasingly precarious balance of military power is to look for strategic allies, ending the three decades of strategic solitude. That’s where Russia comes in. Moscow may become a source of some critical weapons and technologies, such as reconnaissance satellites and fighter jets, where North Korea’s gap with the South is especially glaring. Furthermore, Russia and North Korea could stage joint military drills, a possibility that Sergey Shoigu <a href="https://www.interfax.ru/russia/919195">hinted at</a> even prior to Kim’s visit.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>While the Kim visit to the Russian Far East did not result in any publicized agreements or joint statements, the fact that Russia and the DPRK are engaging in such diplomatic maneuvers is significant in and of itself. In the next few months, we will likely see at least some results from the agreements and/or understandings that Putin and Kim achieved during their talks.</p>
<p>One possible interpretation of Kim’s pilgrimage to Russia is Pyongyang’s quest for security under the circumstances when the balance of military power in and around the peninsula is getting more precarious for North Korea. Given Pyongyang’s extremely constrained domestic resources and inherent limitations of nuclear weapons, it can only rely on external balancing. In a sense, it is going to be a reversal of the Cold War era, when Moscow and Beijing acted as guarantors of military security for Pyongyang. Yet, this time, the division of roles will be somewhat different. China will stay on as Pyongyang’s primary economic benefactor and diplomatic protector, while Russia could play the part of the North’s main military partner. Moscow will be happy with such a role if only because it already has little to lose with Washington, Seoul and Tokyo.</p>
